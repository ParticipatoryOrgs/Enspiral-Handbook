# Enspiral Circles Working Group

## Scope

We are a temporary working group formed to build an agreement about Enspiral Circles (aka multiple member circles).

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/173yuuh9_keXy1RS8ESoDMSHaRVm3wxjGzi5DuvB3oI8/edit#) has some of the initial thinking and [this loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/eFZCGjOL/multiple-member-circles) some of the early responses.

We are active in #wg-enspiral-circles slack channel, feel free to come and engage. Our tickets are tagged [wg-enspiral-circles](https://waffle.io/enspiral/improvements?label=wg-enspiral-circles) on the improvements boad.
