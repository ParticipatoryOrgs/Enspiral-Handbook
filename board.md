# Board of Directors

As a registered New Zealand company, Enspiral Foundation Ltd has to have directors. Enspiral’s goal is to distribute vision, strategy, and leadership as widely as possible in the network, so our approach is a “minimum viable board” (MVB), with a narrow compliance focus. You can see the details in the [Board Agreement](/agreements/board.html).

**Responsibilities**

* Legal and financial compliance
* Management of major risk
* Steward of the Enspiral brand

**Activities**

* Oversee the Foundation’s financial accounts
* Make agreements between the Enspiral Foundation and other entities (MOUs, Service contracts)
* Occasionally make recommendations or raise issues to the members or the network as a whole
* Have some emergency powers to use in rare crisis situations if our other processes have broken down

**Reporting**

The MVB reports regularly to the network as a whole [on Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/oFN6x8t5/re-introducing-the-enspiral-foundation-mvb-board-of-directors-), and participates quarterly venture reporting (since Enspiral Foundation Ltd is itself an Enspiral Venture).

**Scope**

The point of a ‘minimum’ board is that the scope is limited - the MVB specifically focuses on Enspiral Foundation Ltd (not the entire Enspiral network), and within that only governance.

Examples of things within scope:

* an MOU between the Enspiral Foundation and an external organisation
* an issue with one of the Foundation’s service contracts (such as Enspiral Ops)
* a serious concern about brand or reputation risk, or if you’re unsure when it’s OK to use Enspiral’s brand publicly
* a question about running a transaction through the Foundation’s bank account
