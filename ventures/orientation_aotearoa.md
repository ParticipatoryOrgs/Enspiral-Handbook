# Orientation Aotearoa Venture Profile

**Venture Description**

Orientation Aotearoa strives to support young people to gain knowledge, find direction and make change. In 2015, we prototyped an 8 months residential programme in Shelly Bay and supported a pioneering cohort of ten students through a diverse, nourishing and hopefully inspiring programme, consisting of various workshops, a six week internship, a 12 days intensive permaculture course off-side in Otaki, a personal project and a community wide hui.

**Quarterly Update**

July 2016 

Orientation Aotearoa is currently in dormancy. A public statement about next steps will be made by end of this month. 

April 2016

OA 2016 programme did not go ahead, as this residential format was not sustainable, financially, socially and energetically. Orientation Aotearoa is currently in a ‘dormant pause button’ phase, with key members Lucy Carver Skye Chadwick and Babs Lake being overseas, attending a conference at YIP (www.yip.se), a residential education programme for young people in Sweden which provided much of the inspiration for OA. The team will reconvene for a retreat the first weekend of June, to consider how and who will steward OA into the future. 


**Founding Date & Brief History**

Orientation Aotearoa Trust was founded on the 3rd November 2014, and the pilot programme began in April 2015. (Founders: Thomas, Babs, Lucy, Skye and Doris)
