**Quarterly Update**

July 2016 

* We've been honing in on our strategic direction: Working with those who work alongside young people as a way to scale. We encourage participation at every level through a codesign-centric approach, from programmes we run to the projects that the participants might run in their communities.

April 2016 

* In the last quarter we’ve hosted our first community retreat and did a big piece of work with Sovereign Insurance and Youthline Manukau.

**Social Impact Strategy / Theory of Change**

Lifehack positively influences the mental health and wellbeing ecosystem by supporting and building the people who work with or for the wellbeing of young people in New Zealand.
Lifehack exists as the platform for experimentation when it comes to pushing the ‘how’ of improving wellbeing systemically, investigating the driving forces of the issues and building on them coming from a place of strength. 

We are working towards increasing the probability of positively influencing the wicked issue of wellbeing by through experimentation, reflection, learning and iteration. 
We draw and learning, lessons and techniques from a variety of areas, and sit at the intersection of wellbeing science, design, technology and startup world resulting in new approaches being developed for a positive social purpose and common good.
We support individuals, communities, organisations and government who work with and for young people to codesign relevant and appropriate systems and interventions by putting young people at the centre of what they do. Lifehack exists to build the capability and capacity for those who work with young people and on youth wellbeing. We focus on working with with those who have deeply-rooted connections to certain communities and the issues which they’re affected by. These may be individuals, initiatives, or organisations. We facilitate programmes and social processes as safe spaces for reflection, upskilling and prototyping for those who are connected to them.
